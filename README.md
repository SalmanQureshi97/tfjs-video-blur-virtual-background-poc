# TensorFlow.js Background Blur and Virtual Background

This repository demonstrates how to implement background blur and virtual background functionalities using TensorFlow.js and its BodySegmentation model. Ideal for video conferencing applications, online streaming, and virtual events, this project offers a seamless user experience with real-time background manipulation.

## Features

- **Background Blur**: Smoothly blur the background while keeping the subject in focus, enhancing privacy and minimizing distractions during video calls.
- **Virtual Background**: Replace the background with custom images or video streams, creating a professional or themed environment for any occasion.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Leverages TensorFlow.js for efficient, real-time performance directly in the browser.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing web applications with minimal setup.

## Technologies Used

- **TensorFlow.js**: For running machine learning models in the browser.
- **BodySegmentation Model**: To accurately segment the human body from the background.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For creating a user-friendly interface and seamless integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
